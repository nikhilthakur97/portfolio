            Vision Assistance Technology for the Visually Impaired</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>NLP, PyTorch, Computer Vision</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am developing a computer vision-based project utilizing Appleâ€™s models designed for Apple Silicon chips
            such as DETR Resnet50 Semantic Segmentation and Depth Anything V2. This project aims to assist
            vision-impaired individuals by providing real-time information about their surroundings, helping them
            navigate and interact with their environment more effectively.</p>

        <h3>TransLingo: Neural Machine Translation with Seq2Seq</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>NLP, PyTorch, Encoder-Decoder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TransLingo is a neural machine translation project leveraging sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with
            attention mechanisms to translate text from one language to another. Utilizing PyTorch for scalable and
            efficient training, the project aims to provide accurate translations for language pairs such as German to
            English.</p>

        <h3>Restaurant Recommendation System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine Learning, Big Data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Extracted and cleaned data from Yelp, then utilized a distributed storage system for data mining and
            recommendation. Secured 3rd position among 200 students in a class leaderboard by developing a
            recommendation system utilizing Spark, Python, Hadoop, SQL,
            and Java. Achieved an RMSE of 97.42, demonstrating exceptional accuracy and performance. Notably enhanced
            user experience and engagement, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and retention.</p>
